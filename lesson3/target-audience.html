            <hr>
            <p>Tom Bradshaw is a 44 year old who leads a company that provides customer service resources for clients. 
                He has a bachelors degree in business management and years of experience in his field. 
                While his business has earned him a comfortable living, he is seeing little growth for his company in his current state and is constantly searching for skilled workers to fill positions. 
                When Tom visits the Draper Commerce website while browsing on his laptop, he makes his first steps to connecting with skilled workers and generating new clients for his company.</p>

            <hr>
            <p>Theresa Monico started a personal business as a single mother at age 32 by creating crafts and personalized home decor. 
                Her online storefront has been steadily increasing her business, however she believes the next step is to sell her products locally in her home town of Draper, Utah. 
                She discovers her town has a chamber of commerce site while searching on her phone. 
                The website informs her of an upcoming marketplace event where she can sign up for a booth and showcase her business.</p>
